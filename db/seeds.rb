# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# Current Database tables are:
# => User: first_name, last_name, email, password 
# => Restaurant: name, owner_id, address, phone_number, 
# =>             website, description,opening, closing
